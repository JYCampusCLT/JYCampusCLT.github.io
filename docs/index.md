# Jesus Youth Campus Ministry
<div style="text-align: justify">
Campus ministry is one of the most active and lively ministries of the Jesus Youth, having a mission to ‘touch and transform lives in the institutions of higher education’.
<br>
<br>
The ministry enables youth to transform their lives by introducing them to Jesus, encouraging them to grow in a continuous experience of faith, equipping them to be capable of communicating their experience to others and helping them become genuine witnesses for a new evangelisation.
<br>
<br>
The ministry also aims to transform educational institutions into centres of formation and faith sharing. As a result, a number of initiatives has developed within universities, colleges, teachers and students.
